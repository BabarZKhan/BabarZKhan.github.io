This talk will briefly explain the current landscape of quantum computing, focusing on the quantum computing 
compilers that enable efficient quantum algorithms implementation in the embedded systems. To this end, the talk will 
explicitly focus on C++ code snippets to showcase optimization techniques and highlight compiler-specific features.cenario carefully. 
Having gathered a couple interesting instances of such examinations and their findings, we would love to present them!
