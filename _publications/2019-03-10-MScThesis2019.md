In the German city of Duisburg, in the Ruhr district, Intel teams were developing cutting-edge technologies in the field of chip systems for mobile communications using mobile handsets. Assignments encompass the full spectrum, from the concept phase, through hardware and firmware design, to product tests and customer service.

I was part of Verification Management Flow department (pre-silicon verification). My work was related to Verification and Validation of System-on-Chip (SoC) requirements. Meanwhile I also did my Master of Science (M.Sc.) thesis in the same area. Due to NDA (non disclosure agreement) I cannot share the details.
