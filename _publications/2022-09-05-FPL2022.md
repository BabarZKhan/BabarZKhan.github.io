With the trend towards ever larger “big data” applications, many of the gains achievable by using specialized compute accelerators become diminished due to the growing I/O overheads. 
While there have been a number of research efforts
into computational storage and FPGA implementations of the
NVMe interface, to our knowledge there have been only very
limited efforts to move larger parts of the Linux block I/O stack
into FPGA-based hardware accelerators. Our hardware/software
framework DeLiBA aims to address this deficiency by allowing
high-productivity development of software components of the I/O
stack in user instead of kernel space, and leverages a proven
FPGA SoC framework to quickly compose and deploy the actual
FPGA-based I/O accelerators.
While the current version of DeLiBA is focused on enabling
more productive research instead of on raw performance, even
in its current form it achieves 10% higher throughput and up to
2.3x the I/Os per second for a proof-of-concept Ceph accelerator
realized using the system. These initial results show the large
potential of performing further research in this acceleration
domain.
