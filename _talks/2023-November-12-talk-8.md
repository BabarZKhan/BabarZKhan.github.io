This talk was given in-person at Research in Software Engineering Germany Chapter namely "deRSE" in Würzburg, Germany 2024. Following is the abstract of the talk
Software engineers communicate with hardware through a language known as an instruction set architecture (ISA). However, the conclusion of 
Dennard scaling and Moore’s Law implies that complex heterogeneous ISAs are replacing this traditional ISA. In light of this, the expertise
required to develop new compilers and create domain-specific languages will be crucial for future software engineers. Therefore, this talk will 
address the challenges posed by emerging computing architectures and research related to abstracting the complex ISA. As a use case, the talk 
will present an open-source tool that recently received the Best Paper Award at one of the leading computer architecture conferences.
