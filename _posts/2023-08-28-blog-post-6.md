Thanks to the travel grant, I had an opportunity to attend CISPA 2023 in August 2023. The CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security is a German national Big Science Institution within the Helmholtz Association. Their research encompasses all aspects of Information Security. This yearâ€˜s international CISPA Summer School had a focus on System Security with one week of talks, hands-on sessions, discussions, and a social program such as a pub quiz. The event included sessions by 8 invited speakers and 5 CISPA Faculty.
