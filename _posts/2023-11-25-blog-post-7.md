Last week, I attended SC 2023 in Denver, Colorado, USA. The SC Conference brought together a vast assembly of participants, numbering 14 thousand this year, from the international high-performance computing community. It served as a nexus for scientists, engineers, researchers, educators, programmers, system administrators, and developers worldwide. Simultaneously, SC provided manufacturers, vendors, research institutions, and HPC service providers with a venue in the form of an exhibition. This year's event featured approximately 438 exhibitors, among them Seagate.

As a software-hardware engineer and PhD candidate specializing in storage research, I have always been fascinated by products from storage vendors. Consequently, I visited the Seagate booth. Fortunately, at the Seagate booth, I had the opportunity to be introduced to the new hard disk drive (HDD) called HAMR (pronounced "hammer") by Ted Oade, Director of Product Marketing at Seagate Technology. Specifically, it was the 30TB Exos X, as depicted in the figure. The Seagate Exos is a high-performing multi-petabyte capacity block storage system that offers mass storage for traditional data centers and cloud infrastructure.
