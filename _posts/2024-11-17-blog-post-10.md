In 2023, I had attended the in-person International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (commonly known as SC 2023) in Denver, Colorado, USA. Being November in Denver, the weather was as expected—cold but sunny (my kind of weather). SC is always a week-long event, and since I arrived a day or two before the official start, I decided to collect my badge early to avoid the long queues on opening day. After picking up my badge, I thought, why not take a walk around the Colorado Convention Center as a warm-up for the upcoming conference days? While exploring the area, I noticed some talks taking place in one of the halls at the Convention Center. It turned out to be the STEM-Trek pre-conference workshop, specifically ART@SC23. STEM-Trek is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing education and initiatives in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The workshop was led by its founder, Elizabeth Leake (she is just great), who also serves as a project manager for advanced cyberinfrastructure at Texas A&M University. Every talk was incredibly insightful and engaging, without exception. Attending ART@SC23 became one of the standout highlights of my SC 2023 experience. Naturally, this year when I traveled to attend SC 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, it was clear that I wouldn’t miss the pre-conference ART@SC24 workshop. This year’s workshop had an artificial intelligence (AI) theme, which was evident in the talks, tours, and programs throughout. The overarching theme of SC 2024, “HPC Creates,” was prominently displayed on the jackets provided to workshop attendees—a thoughtful touch, especially appreciated by those visiting from warmer climates as the temperatures dropped during the week. The ART@SC24 workshop was also mentioned in HPCwire, a well-known online news source for high-performance computing (HPC). On a personal note, I am glad to see my short academic bio featured in HPCwire—something to cherish in my journey within the HPC community.
