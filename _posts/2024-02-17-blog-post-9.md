I have not been involved in Quantum Computing research topics, but like most researchers (read PhD candidate) in Computer Science and software-hardware engineer, I have been intrigued by the topic. Attending SC 2023 in Denver, Colorado, USA, was icing on the cake where QC was a dominating topic both in research and industrial tracks. Luckily the stars aligned and I had an opportunity to attend virtually Quantum Computing (QC) Winter School 2024 in February 2024 by Infineon. Infineon Technologies AG is Germany's largest semiconductor manufacturer.
