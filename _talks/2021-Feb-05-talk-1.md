Hardware accelerators are being increasingly integrated into todayâ€™s heterogenous computing systems to achieve improved performance. However, the resulting heterogenous hardware also increases the challenge to ensure the security of these accelerators. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) automates the creation of a register transfer level (RTL) description of a digital circuit starting from its high-level specification (e.g., C/C++/SystemC). In this talk, I would like to discuss different extensions and methodologies to High-Level Synthesis (HLS) compilers for generating secure accelerators. Precisely addressing the HLS vulnerabilities like side-channel listed in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list.
