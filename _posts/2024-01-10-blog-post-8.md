To stay well-informed about the scientific (fine-granular) aspects of Artificial Intelligence, I took the opportunity to enroll in an instructor-led training program titled "Building Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing Applications." Through this training, I acquired knowledge on utilizing Transformer-based natural language processing models for tasks like text classification, including the categorization of documents. Additionally, I learned how to harness Transformer-based models for tasks such as named-entity recognition (NER). The training equipped me with the skills to analyze different model features, constraints, and characteristics, enabling me to determine the most suitable model for a specific use case based on metrics, domain specificity, and available resources.
