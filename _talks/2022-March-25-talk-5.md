Many say that FPGAs are the new motherboards. And I have been working on compiling best coding practices to develop designs on FPGAs through C++. Therefore this talk is a continuation of my on going work regarding these best coding practices. If you are a C++ developer and you want to develop designs for FPGA through C++ explicitly, this talk will cover essential coding practices for you.
