This talk titled "DeLiBA: An Open-Source Hardware/Software Framework for the Development of Linux Block I/O Accelerators"
was part of FPGA design track of FPL 2022 conference. The International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) was the first and remains the largest conference 
covering the rapidly growing area of field-programmable logic and reconfigurable computing. 
During the past 31 years, many of the advances in reconfigurable system architectures, applications, 
embedded processors, design automation methods and tools were first published in the proceedings of 
the FPL conference series. The conference objective is to bring together researchers and practitioners 
from both academia and industry and from around the world.
