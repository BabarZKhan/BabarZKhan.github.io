Last week, I attended SC 2023 in Denver, Colorado, USA. The SC Conference brought together a vast assembly of participants, numbering 14 thousand this year, from the international high-performance computing community. It served as a nexus for scientists, engineers, researchers, educators, programmers, system administrators, and developers worldwide. Simultaneously, SC provided manufacturers, vendors, research institutions, and HPC service providers with a venue in the form of an exhibition. This year's event featured approximately 438 exhibitors, among them Seagate.

As a software-hardware engineer and PhD candidate specializing in storage research, I have always been fascinated by products from storage vendors. Consequently, I visited the Seagate booth. Fortunately, at the Seagate booth, I had the opportunity to be introduced to the new hard disk drive (HDD) called HAMR (pronounced "hammer") by Ted Oade, Director of Product Marketing at Seagate Technology. Specifically, it was the 30TB Exos X, as depicted in the figure. The Seagate Exos is a high-performing multi-petabyte capacity block storage system that offers mass storage for traditional data centers and cloud infrastructure.

The technology was initially seen as extremely difficult to achieve, 
with doubts expressed about its feasibility in 2013.[1] 
The regions being written must be heated in a tiny area - 
small enough that diffraction prevents the use of normal laser focused heating - and requires a heating, writing and cooling cycle of less than 1 nanosecond, while also controlling the effects of repeated spot-heating on the drive platters, the drive-to-head contact, and the adjacent magnetic data which must not be affected. These challenges required the development of nano-scale surface plasmons (surface guided laser) instead of direct laser-based heating, new types of glass platters and heat-control coatings that tolerate rapid spot-heating without affecting the contact with the recording head or nearby data, new methods to mount the heating laser onto the drive head, and a wide range of other technical, development and control issues that needed to be overcome.[2][3]

HAMR drives have the same form factor (size and layout) 
as existing traditional hard drives, and do not require any change to the computer 
or other device in which they are installed; they can be used identically to existing hard drives.







The technology relies on storing information on rotating disks with a 
nanometer-thick media lubricant, and they can leverage shingled recording 
without any degradation in performance. 

That's why it's possible to cram up to 100TB of available storage 
capacity onto a single HAMR unit, while the biggest hard drives out 
there right now are only up to 28TB in size. The drive in particular is 
the WD Ultrastar DC HC680 Data Center HDD as well as Seagate's Exos X24 28TB drive.

The 29TB hard drive that's being produced for Seagate's Exos Corvault 
unit will become the largest hard drive anybody can use — but they still 
won't be able to buy individual units to be fitted, say, into their 
own network-attached storage (NAS) drives. 

Instead, users hoping to use a high-powered, high-capacity HAMR hard 
drive at their own discretion will have to wait until next year, 
when Seagate launches its first 30TB HAMR HDD. 































Seagate announced this week that it had begun the first commercial revenue shipments 
of its next-generation HAMR hard drives, which are being shipped out as part of 
Seagate's latest Corvault storage systems. This commercialization marks an 
important milestone in the HDDs market, as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) 
is expected to enable hard drives with capacities of 50 TB and beyond. Meanwhile, 
HDDs employing perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) and shingled magnetic recording (SMR) 
technologies are expected to remain on the market for the foreseeable future.

"We shipped our first HAMR-based Corvault system for revenue as planned during the 
June quarter," said Gianluca Romano, chief financial officer of Seagate, at 
the company's earnings call. "We expect broader availability of these CORVAULT 
systems by the end of calendar 2023."















Renew drives automatically with built-in Seagate ADAPT and Autonomous Drive Regeneration (ADR). 
While data creation is growing exponentially, IT teams and budgets are not. 
That’s why we built CORVAULT. Store mass data with a new category of intelligent storage 
that utilizes Autonomous Drive Regeneration (ADR) to minimize downtime, human intervention, 
and e-waste by renewing errant drives in situ. That means fewer opportunities 
for human error and more cost savings.

Reduces the environmental impact of computer e-waste as ADR drives are renewed instead of discarded.
Dramatically reduces manual drive swaps.
Enhance data availability, durability, and sustainability while reducing its carbon footprint, e-waste, and TCO.
Experience enterprise storage that’s like a single hard drive with multi-petabyte capacity. 
With CORVAULT, data centers benefit from hyperscale efficiencies, rapid deployment, 
streamlined data management, and reduced human intervention. The solution reduces e-waste 
by supporting sustainable data center architectures that consume less host CPU, RAM, 
and networking resources by up to 50%, which slashes CO² footprints and operational costs. 
This is all enabled by Seagate breakthrough data protection technologies using 
Exos enterprise hard drives and Seagate storage controllers: Autonomic Distributed 
Allocation Protection Technology (ADAPT) erasure coding combined with 
Autonomous Drive Regeneration (ADR) that renews hard drives on demand.
