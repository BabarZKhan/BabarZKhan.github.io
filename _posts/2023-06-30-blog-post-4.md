During my PhD I have been working on topics related to Linux operating system (to be precise Linux storage) and
open source projects. This compelled me to attend in-person DevConf.CZ in Brno, Czech Republic 2023 that is annual, free, Red Hat sponsored community conference for developers, admins, DevOps engineers, testers, documentation writers and other contributors to open source technologies. 
Although it was a three days event with a very interesting itinerary of technical talks, below is the list of some of the talks relevant to my research and everyday tasks:
