FPGAs in general are notorioulsy famous for having a difficult programming model. Given that, there has been a growing focus to design FPGA hardware at a higher level of abstraction through high-level languages. Modern C++ is clearly a winner in this case. The last four C++ standards have come a long way to make C++ language even more compatible with embedded sytems. Many open source FPGA libraries are based on modern C++. Similarly, almost every open-source high-level synthesis (HLS) compiler for FPGA is either based on GCC or LLVM/Clang. This talk will show how a modern C++ developer can adopt certain coding practises to fully exploit the underlying spatial parallelism of FPGA hardware.
