With the trend towards ever larger “big data” applications, many of the gains achievable by using specialized
compute accelerators become diminished due to the growing I/O overheads. While there have been several research efforts into computational storage and FPGA implementations of the NVMe interface, to our knowledge
there have been only very limited efforts to move larger parts of the Linux block I/O stack into FPGA-based
hardware accelerators. Our hardware/software framework DeLiBA initially addressed this deficiency by
allowing high-productivity development of software components of the I/O stack in user instead of kernel
space and leverages a proven FPGA SoC framework to quickly compose and deploy the actual FPGA-based I/O
accelerators. In its initial form, it achieves 10% higher throughput and up to 2.3× the I/Os per second (IOPS) for
a proof-of-concept Ceph accelerator running in a real multi-node Ceph cluster. In DeLiBA2, we have extended
the framework further to better support distributed storage systems, specifically by directly integrating the
block I/O accelerators with a hardware-accelerated network stack, as well as by accelerating more storage
functions. With these improvements, performance grows significantly: The cluster-level speed-ups now reach
up to 2.8× for both throughput and IOPS relative to Ceph in software in synthetic benchmarks, and achieve
end-to-end wall clock speed-ups of 20% for the real workload of building a large software package.
