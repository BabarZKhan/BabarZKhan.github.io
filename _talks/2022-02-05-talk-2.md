Although Linux is still the best preferred operating system, the talk begins with a problem statement regarding the dependencies of ANTLR and LLVM on Windows. To this end, the presenter will explain how these dependency issues can be resolved through an easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native LLVM and ANTLR on Windows. Furthermore, the talk will briefly explain how we can design domain specific languages (DSLs) using a powerful combination of ANTLR and LLVM front end while maintaining a logical isolation of parsing and code generation.
